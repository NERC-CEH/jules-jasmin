================


This file sets up the switches that control model behaviour. It contains a single namelist named :nml:lst:`JULES_SWITCHES`.


``JULES_SWITCHES`` namelist members
-----------------------------------

.. nml:namelist:: JULES_SWITCHES

.. nml:member:: l_aggregate

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch controlling number of tiles for each gridbox.

   This is used to set the number of surface energy balances that are solved for each gridbox (``ntiles``).

   TRUE
       Aggregate parameter values are used to solve a single energy balance per gridbox. This option sets ``ntiles = 1``.

   FALSE
       A separate energy balance is calculated for each surface type. This option sets ``ntiles = ntype``.


.. nml:member:: can_model

   :type: integer
   :permitted: 1-4
   :default: 4

   Choice of canopy model for vegetation:

   1. No canopy.
   2. Radiative canopy with no heat capacity.
   3. Radiative canopy with heat capacity. This option is deprecated, with 4 preferred.
   4. As 3 but with a representation of snow beneath the canopy. This option is preferred to 3.

   .. note::
       :nml:mem:`can_model` = 1 does not mean that there is no vegetation canopy. It means that the surface is represented as a single entity, rather than having distinct surface and canopy levels for the purposes of radiative processes.


.. nml:member:: can_rad_mod

   :type: integer
   :permitted: 1-5
   :default: 4

   Switch for treatment of canopy radiation.

   1. A single canopy layer for which radiation absorption is calculated using Beer's law. Leaf-level photosynthesis is scaled to the canopy level using the 'big leaf' approach. Leaf nitrogen, photosynthetic capacity, i.e the Vcmax parameter, and leaf photosynthesis vary exponentially through the canopy with radiation.

   2. Multi-layer approach for radiation interception following the 2-stream approach of Sellers et al. (1992). This approach takes into account leaf angle distribution, zenith angle, and differentiates absorption of direct and diffuse radiation. Leaf-level photosynthesis is calculated using a vertically-varying light-limited rate, and constant Rubisco and export velocities, consistent with the assumption of constant leaf N through the canopy. Canopy photosynthesis and conductance are calculated as the sum over all layers.

   3. As 2, but photosynthesis calculated separately for sunlit and shaded leaves for the whole canopy (i.e. not at each layer). The definition of sunlit and shaded leaves is based on a threshold of absorbed radiation at each layer.

   4. This is a modification of option 2. Instead of constant leaf N through the canopy, it has an exponential decline of leaf N with canopy height. Additionally includes inhibition of leaf respiration in the light.

   5. This is an improvement of option 4, including:

      * Sunfleck penetration though the canopy.
      * Division of sunlit and shaded leaves within each canopy level.
      * A modified version of inhibition of leaf respiration in the light.

   .. note:: When using :nml:mem:`can_rad_mod` = 4 or 5, it is recommended to use driving data that contains direct and diffuse radiation separately rather than a constant diffuse fraction.

   .. seealso:: Descriptions 1, 2 and 3 can be found in Jogireddy et al. (2006), and an application of option 4 can be found in Mercado et al. (2007) and all are described in Clark et al (2011).

   TRUE
       Calculate zenith angle.

   FALSE

   :type: logical
   :default: T

   Switch for using prognostic snow properties in model albedo.
   
   Requires :nml:mem:`l_spec_albedo` = TRUE.
   
   TRUE
       Use prognostic snow properties for albedo.

   Switch for competing vegetation.
   
   Only used if :nml:mem:`l_triffid` = TRUE.

   TRUE
       TRIFFID will let the different PFTs compete against each other and modify the vegetation fractions.

   FALSE
       Vegetation fractions do not change.


.. nml:member:: l_trif_eq

   :type: logical

   Switch for equilibrium vegetation model (i.e., an equilibrium solution of TRIFFID).

   TRUE
       Use Q10 approach.

       layer becomes subsurface runoff.

   FALSE

.. nml:member:: soilhc_method

   :type: integer
   :permitted: 1 or 2
   :default: 1

   Switch for soil thermal conductivity model.

   1. Use approach of Cox et al (1999), as in JULES2.0.
   2. Use approach of Johansen (1975).


.. nml:member:: l_point_data

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Flag indicating if driving data are point or area-average values. This affects the treatment of precipitation input and how snow affects the albedo.

   TRUE
       Driving data are point data. Precipitation is not distributed in space (see FALSE below) and is all assumed to be large-scale in origin. The albedo formulation is suitable for a point.

   FALSE
       Driving data are area averages. The precipitation inputs are assumed to be exponentially distributed in space, as in UMDP25, and can include convective and large-scale components. The albedo formulation is suitable for a gridbox.

   :type: logical
   :default: F
   
   Switch to enable calculation of BVOC emissions.
   
   TRUE
       BVOC emissions diagnostics will be calculated.
       
   FALSE
       BVOC emissions diagnostics will not be calculated.
   


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [*] In the JULES2.0 User Manual this was described as the 'Clapp and Hornberger' model and the JULES code still refers to 'Clapp and Hornberger' rather than 'Brooks and Corey'. In fact there are important differences between these two hydraulic models (Toby Marthews, pers comm.). There has been confusion in the literature and in past documentation of MOSES/JULES, resulting in these differences often being ignored, but JULES uses the Brooks and Corey model. Hopefully this confusion will be removed from future releases.

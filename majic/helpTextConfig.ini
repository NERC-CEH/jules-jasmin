vd-help-layers=The list below contains the currently selected layers. By expanding the dataset tree in the datasets tab above, layers can be found and they will be added to the list when clicked on. The layers below can be dragged to reorder them. They can be  hidden by unchecking the display box and removed from the list by clicking on the remove button. Clicking on a layer in the list makes it the current layer for legend display, for setting styles and dimensions values, and for animation. If the default outline layer is removed from the list it can be added again by clicking on the "Outline Map" entry in the datasets tab.

vd-help-bounding-box=Bounding box coordinates set in this box are used to limit the view for figures and exports. Also, the map will zoom into the selected region when the values are changed and the "Set selection" button is pressed. The "Reset selection" button removes any bounding box and zooms out fully. A bounding box may also be set by dragging on the map when the zoom map tool is selected.

vd-help-dimensions=This tab contains controls for setting values of additional dimensions when a layer is selected that has such dimensions. If the dimension has more than one possible value, the following will be available: a drop down selector for dimension values, a progress bar (which may be clicked on to move to the corresponding value) and stepper control buttons for moving to the first value, stepping backwards, stepping forwards and moving to the last value. If a dimension has only one possible value, that value will be displayed without the controls.

vd-help-style=This tab contains controls for setting the display style for the selected layer. If the WMS server provides only one style, this cannot be changed. The server may provide display options, in which case they will be displayed underneath.
vd-help-style-display-options=The display options provide aditional control over the style and colour map. The options available depend on the style and server.

vd-help-figure-format=This sets the file format for the figure.
vd-help-figure-height=This sets the height of the image in the figure. The sizes of the caption and legend are not included within this height.
vd-help-figure-width=This sets the width of the image in the figure.
vd-help-figure-grid=If this is selected, a latitude and longitude grid is drawn on the figure.
vd-help-figure-caption-include=These checkboxes allow selection of the details to be included in the caption.

vd-help-animation-download=When the "Make file" button is pressed, the export file will be created on the server. The time taken may be substantial, depending on the number of frames to be created and the response time of the WMS server providing the images. When the file is ready, a link will appear below, from which the file may be saved or opened. The link will disappear if any of the export settings are changed. However, the export file will still be available for some time after creation, so can be retrieved if the link is bookmarked or saved.
vd-help-animation-format=This sets the format of the export file. It may be a video format or an XML format that contains URLs for each frame.
vd-help-animation-prefix=If a name is entered here, it will form the start of the download file name. A random part is added to the name to prevent duplication. The entered name can only contain alphabetical and numeric characters, and "_" and "-". It is limited in length to 20 characters.
vd-help-animation-dimension=This selects the dimension over which animation will occur. For KML, if the selected dimension is not time, a layer will be produced for each dimension value, but no animation will occur.
vd-help-animation-start=This sets the starting value over which animation will occur.
vd-help-animation-end=This sets the end value over which animation will occur.
vd-help-animation-number-steps=This sets the number of steps in the animation (e.g., the number of frames in a video). The maximum allowed is the number of dimension values from the currently set start to end values, restricted to an overall maximum. The number of steps is initially set to five.
vd-help-animation-height=This sets the height of the image in the animation. For formats that include a caption and/or legend, the sizes of these are not included within this height.
vd-help-animation-width=This sets the width of the image in the animation.
vd-help-animation-framerate=This sets the framerate for the animation video as the number of frames per second. The duration of the video will be (number of frames - 1)/framerate. For formats with restricted framerates, this may be ignored or changed to the nearest valid value.
vd-help-animation-grid=If this is selected, a latitude and longitude grid is drawn on the video.
vd-help-animation-caption-include=These checkboxes allow selection of the details to be included in the caption.

vd-help-data-download=When the "Make file" button is pressed, the export file will be created on the server. The time taken may be substantial, depending on the amount of data requested and the response time of the WCS server providing the data. When the file is ready, a link will appear below, from which the file may be saved or opened. The link will disappear if any of the export settings are changed. However, the export file will still be available for some time after creation, so can be retrieved if the link is bookmarked or saved.
vd-help-data-format=This sets the format of the export file - fixed value of 'WCS'.
vd-help-data-prefix=If a name is entered here, it will form the start of the download file name. A random part is added to the name to prevent duplication. The entered name can only contain alphabetical and numeric characters, and "_" and "-". It is limited in length to 20 characters.
vd-help-data-dimension=This selects the dimension over which a range is to be set.
vd-help-data-start=This sets the starting value for the dimension range.
vd-help-data-end=This sets the end value for the dimension range.
vd-help-data-number-steps=This shows the number of steps in the dimension range. An error will be shown if the number of steps is too large. The number of steps is initially set to one.
